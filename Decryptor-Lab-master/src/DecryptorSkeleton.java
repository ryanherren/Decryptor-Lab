/**
 * For this mini-assignment, the goal is to git you guys more familiar with Git.
 * You'll need to finish each of the methods. We made certain to make each method
 * relatively simple, as we are aware not everyone has experience with Java yet.
 *
 * Fear not, most of these can be solved with simple Google searches. The primary
 * goal is to make it such that each one of your team members makes at least one
 * commit (most likely a commit per method completion). Once finished, show your
 * TA the working code, as well as your Git history showing every team member
 * made a contribution. Explain what problems you had. Did you get your first
 * taste of merge conflicts? Potentially this could have been separated into multiple
 * files? What are your thoughts?
 *
 * Remember, GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND! If you feel you're working too hard on a problem,
 * you most likely are. Oh, and if you are completely new to Java, you're going to
 * love how much easier it is to work with arrays (and other data structures) in this
 * language as opposed to C (The C solution for this is literally like 8x more complex).
 *
 * Place your @author tags here.
